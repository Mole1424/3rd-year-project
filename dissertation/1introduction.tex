\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction to deepfakes and a brief history
    \item Mention things like initially coined on reddit, and their rise to popularity
    \item can be used for a variety of illegal activities, misinformation, etc
    \item adversarial noise
    \item deepfake detection via CNNs
    \item the aim of the project
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the title but looong
    \end{itemize}
    \item objectives
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First objectives
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Identify a methodology for detecting DeepFakes
            \item Identify how to implement such a methodology
            \item Implement such a methodology
            \item Evaluate the feasibility of the produced method through standardised benchmarks
        \end{enumerate}
        \item{Optional (Extensions)}
        Should all the essential objectives be completed the following could be implemented given sufficient time:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Enhance the chosen methodology through speed improvements, accuracy, etc.
            \item Test the benefit of any potential improvement using standardised benchmarks
        \end{enumerate}
        \item New Objectives
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Implement eye landmark detection
            \item Calculate ear over time
            \item analysis of ear graph to determine real or fake
            \item implement a control set of models (state-of-the-art)
            \item investigate and implement methods of adding adversarial noise
            \item compare and benchmark over dataset(s)
        \end{enumerate}
        \item New Objectives (further)
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Evaluate transferability of blink-detection across different datasets
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Unique contributions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First use of time series analysis on EAR graph
        \item Evaluation of blink detection on standard datasets
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
