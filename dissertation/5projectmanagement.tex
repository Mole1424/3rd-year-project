\label{ch:projman}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Contrast original and actual gantt chart and explain reasons for changing (compilers, the eye landmarking models, pyts library)
    \item emphasise recovery from eye landmarking model pain (using pre-existing methods where possible, buffer weeks, etc)
    \item resources used
    \item using kudu where possible compared to avon due to cost and ease of access
    \item only hammering kudu over the easter as less people and selfless
\end{itemize}
