\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item This Project has shown blink-based detection via EAR analysis is both viable and resilient against adversarial noise attack
    \item It shows that advanced univariate time series analysis can be used to detect DeepFakes across a wide a variety of example DeepFake datasets, a first
    \item It shows that blink based deepfake detection is unaffected by adversarial attacks from FGSM
\end{itemize}

\section{Author's Assessment of Project}

\begin{itemize}
    \item overall the project was successful, although the scope had to be narrowed significantly
    \item explain initial sadness with scrapping WSELD, but then happy with the way i handled it
    \item overall happy with the final results but wish testing could have been done on more attacks
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Research Suggestions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item more comprehensive research into this specific area
    \begin{itemize}
        \item look into other methods
        \item better EAR analysis
    \end{itemize}
    \item Diffusion models for noise reduction
    \item potential development temporal noise
    \item more subtle temporal dependencies like heartbeat detection and breathing
\end{itemize}

\section{Open Source Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item open source helped me so help back
    \item main thing being deprecation
    \item a couple actual bugs tho
\end{itemize}
