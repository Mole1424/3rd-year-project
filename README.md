# Evaluating the Resiliency of Blink-Based DeepFake Detection Against Adversarial Noise

The central repository for my 3rd year project at the University of Warwick. The project is focused on detecting DeepFakes using blink detection and then evaluating how resilient the detection is to adversarial noise.

## Project Structure

General guide to each folder in the repository, see each directory's README for more details.

### Datasets

Added to gitignore for both licensing and size reasons. For access to datasets, see individual dataset's website (full list of datasets used can be found in the report). If you're marking this, it will contain either download scripts, zips, or links to access the datasets.

### Demonstrations

Assorted random code for showing off this project for opendays and presentations, this is not intended to be used for anything and was probably written several pints deep, but it worked!

### Dissertation

Fancy reading an upsettingly large number of words about this project? Have far too much time on your hands and dont know what to do with it? Hate reading nice, pdf docs, and just love raw LaTeX? Well, this is the folder for you! Contains the LaTeX source code for my dissertation. (thanks overleaf!)

### Final Code

The code that actually matters.

### Models

Again in the gitignore for size reasons. Would otherwise contain saved model weights/architectures. If marking, this will actually contain stuff! (sorry tabula)

### Progress Report

Essentially a big lit review, and a naively optimistic timeline for the project (tbf it went good).

### Proof of Concept

Quick and dirty code that i wrote over the holidays to make sure my idea had some merit (it did ðŸ¥³)

### Specification

The barebones idea of the project and rough deliverables, has changed significantly since then.

### Root folder

Assorted stuff like gitignore, requirements.txt, ruff linting, README. Also has the final report and presentation pdfs as well as the TODO to track my progress.
