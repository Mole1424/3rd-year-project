# Evaluating the Performance of Blink Detection on DeepFakes Injected With Adversarial Noise

The central repository for my 3rd year project at the University of Warwick. The project is focused on detecting DeepFakes using blink detection and then evaluating how resilient the detection is to adversarial noise.
