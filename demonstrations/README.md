#  A collection of code for demos of the project

## EAR

Plots sample EAR plots from one of the EAR training set

## Live demo

From a webcam, maps the eye landmarks and live shows the generation of an EAR graph. Can also do live showing of the video with the landmarks drawn on.  
Written on my laptop so assumes all paths are in the same environment as the code.

## Model View

Visualises model architectures.

## Noise visualisation

Adds noise to an image, creating an image of the frame with noise added and a visualisation of the noise added
